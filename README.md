This sample implements the *publisher side* of a marketplace SaaS subscription — the
"fulfillment plane" that keeps a subscription in sync with Microsoft:

- a buyer **SSO landing page** (Resolve → explicit-confirm Activate),
- a **connection webhook** (validated server-side),
- an **authoritative subscription-state store**, and
- a **minimal publisher admin** page.

You can run it two ways: deploy a **cloud demo** to Azure with one command, or run it entirely
**on your machine** (no Azure). The official
[SaaS Accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/Commercial-Marketplace-SaaS-Accelerator) (MIT)
is used as a reference (not forked), and the
[Fulfillment API Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/Commercial-Marketplace-SaaS-API-Emulator) (MIT)
stands in for the marketplace, so no real purchase is needed.

**New to marketplace SaaS?** Start with the [experience walkthrough](docs/walkthrough.md) —
a plain-language map of who does what, and how it maps to the code here.

## Two ways to run it

| | **Deploy a cloud demo** | **Run locally** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| For | a live URL others can click through the full lifecycle | developing, testing, trying it out |
| Command | `azd up` | `dotnet run` / `dotnet test` |
| State store | **Azure SQL** — the authoritative store, reached passwordless via managed identity | **SQLite** — zero setup, runs on any machine (incl. arm64) |
| Azure needed? | Yes (an Azure subscription) | No |

SQLite is the *local development* store (nothing to install, runs anywhere); Azure SQL is the
*authoritative* store used in the cloud. Same app, same code — only `Database:Provider` differs.

### Deploy a cloud demo (azd)

One command provisions Azure and deploys three things — the **app**, its **Azure SQL** state
store, and the **Fulfillment API Emulator** (Microsoft's token-free marketplace stand-in, on
Azure Container Apps). The result is a live URL anyone can click through the whole subscription
lifecycle — no local setup, no real purchase. This is the automated version of the step-by-step
[docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md). New to `azd`? See the
[Azure Developer CLI docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview).

```bash
# one-time: install the Azure Developer CLI (https://aka.ms/azd-install),
# the Azure CLI, and sqlcmd; then sign in:
azd auth login

azd up      # pick an environment name, subscription, and region
            # → provisions App Service + Azure SQL + the emulator (Container Apps)
            # → deploys everything (a few minutes), then prints the app and emulator URLs

azd down    # remove everything when you're done
```

Buyer sign-in is **off** by default, so there's nothing to configure. `azd up` prints an
**Endpoint** URL for each service — the **emulator** and the **app** (run `azd show` to see them
again). Open the emulator endpoint and drive the whole lifecycle from the browser:

1. On the **emulator** — its home page is the Marketplace purchase page — pick a plan and click
   **Continue**. The emulator hands the app a purchase token and opens the app's landing page for you.
2. On the app's **landing page**, review the resolved subscription and click **Activate** — the
   state becomes **Subscribed**. Follow the **Publisher admin** link on the page to see it stored.
3. Back in the emulator, click the **Subscriptions** tab (top nav) and drive events on your
   subscription — **Suspend**, **Reinstate**, **Change plan**, **Unsubscribe** (each fires the
   connection webhook to the app).
4. In the app's **Publisher admin**, refresh to watch the authoritative state follow each event
   (allow a few seconds for the emulator's notification delay).

> `azd up` prints these steps (with your two URLs) in the terminal when it finishes — start at
> the **emulator** URL; the app's own URL is where the buyer lands.

For a production-shaped deploy against the **real** marketplace (sign-in on, no emulator, each
step explained), see [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md).

> **Language:** the app UI is available in **English and 日本語**. It follows your browser
> language by default, and a header **EN / 日本語** toggle switches it anytime.

### Run locally

You only need the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0).
No Docker, no Azure, no marketplace purchase.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MamoruKuroda/marketplace-saas-agent-sample
cd marketplace-saas-agent-sample

# Prove the whole subscription lifecycle end to end
# (Resolve → Activate → webhook → state), all over local HTTP:
dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName~SyntheticL2LifecycleTests

# …or run the app and open the publisher admin page:
dotnet run --project src/SaaSAgentSample.Web
#   → http://localhost:5134/admin
```

In development the app uses a local SQLite store, sign-in is off, and the fulfillment
client points at the emulator — so the whole flow works with nothing else installed. For the
full local dev reference — providers, migrations, configuration, and the SQL Server tests —
see [docs/develop.md](docs/develop.md).

<details>
<summary>Terminology (v0, L2, Tier-1…)</summary>

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Tier-1 flat-rate** | A Microsoft pricing model: one fixed monthly price per subscription (no metered or per-user billing). |
| **Fulfillment plane** | The publisher side: landing page, connection webhook, and subscription-state store. |
| **v0** | This first version of the sample — everything runs locally. |
| **L2** | An integration-level end-to-end proof: the app talks to a fulfillment API over real HTTP (emulated) and runs the full subscription lifecycle. |
| **Synthetic L2** | The automated in-repo variant — an HTTP stub replaces the Docker emulator, so no Docker is needed. |

## Architecture

Running **locally**, everything is on one machine (below). Deployed as a **cloud demo** with
`azd`, the same pieces run on Azure — the app on App Service, Azure SQL as the state store, and
the Fulfillment API Emulator on Azure Container Apps — so the whole clickable flow works with
nothing installed. (The production-shaped [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md) targets the *real*
marketplace instead of the emulator.)

## Solution layout

| Project | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/SaaSAgentSample.Core` | Domain model (subscription, state, plan); infrastructure-agnostic |
| `src/SaaSAgentSample.Data` | EF Core state store (single source of truth); SQL Server / Azure SQL |
| `src/SaaSAgentSample.Fulfillment` | Fulfillment/Operations API v2 client + server-side webhook validation |
| `src/SaaSAgentSample.Web` | Buyer SSO landing, connection webhook, publisher admin |
| `tests/SaaSAgentSample.Tests` | Unit + integration (synthetic end-to-end) tests |
| `infra/`, `azure.yaml`, `scripts/` | `azd` cloud deploy: Bicep for App Service + Azure SQL + the emulator (Container Apps), plus the fetch/post-provision hooks |

## Develop & test locally

The [Run locally](#run-locally) quickstart above is all you need to see it work. For the full
local reference — database providers (SQLite / SQL Server / Azure SQL), migrations, running the
app, configuration, and the SQL Server integration tests — see **[docs/develop.md](docs/develop.md)**.

**Prove it end to end (L2):** run the whole fulfillment lifecycle (Resolve → Activate → webhook →
state) with no real purchase — an automated test drives it over real HTTP, no Docker required:

```bash
dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName~SyntheticL2LifecycleTests
```

Details, including the manual emulator path: [docs/l2-demo.md](docs/l2-demo.md).

## Agent layer — planned, not yet built

This repository is named `marketplace-saas-agent-sample` to reflect its **founding design**: an
LLM tool-calling layer (promotable to
[Azure AI Foundry Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/overview))
as a core element alongside the fulfillment plane. Marketplace fulfillment operations (Resolve,
Activate, Get Subscription, webhook operations) map naturally to typed tool calls, making the
subscription lifecycle drivable by an LLM with explicit confirmation guardrails.

**v0 — this version — contains the fulfillment plane only:** the landing page, webhook, state
store, and publisher admin described in this README. The agent / LLM layer is not yet implemented.

When built, the agent layer will expose the fulfillment operations as tools and let a conversational
agent drive the lifecycle end to end — while the state DB remains the single source of truth for
every state-changing call.

## Guardrails

A few rules this sample never breaks:

- The state DB is the single source of truth; subscription state comes only from the store
  and the Fulfillment API — the app never invents it.
- State-changing actions require explicit confirmation.
- No purchase/bearer tokens, secrets, or unnecessary PII in logs.
- Webhook Authorization is validated server-side (Entra JWT + Get Operation).

## Deploy

Target: Azure App Service (.NET 10) + Azure SQL, with the app connecting to the database
passwordless via managed identity. Provisioning is human-authorized — nothing here deploys
automatically.

- **One command:** `azd up` — see [Deploy a cloud demo](#deploy-a-cloud-demo-azd) above. It
  provisions everything defined in `infra/` and deploys the app **and the emulator**, for a
  fully clickable demo.
- **Step by step:** [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md) walks each `az` command — provisioning,
  managed-identity SQL access, app settings, deploy, and wiring the offer's landing page +
  connection webhook. Use it to understand each resource, or for a production-shaped setup.
